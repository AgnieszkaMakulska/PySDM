# Introduction

# Dependencies and supported platforms 

# API in brief

# Selected relevant recent open-source developments

The SDM algorithm implementations are part of the following open-source packages (of otherwise largely differing functionality):

   - `libcloudph++` in C++ [@Arabas_et_al_2015;@Jaruga_and_Pawlowska_2018] with Python bindings [@Jarecka_et_al_2015];
   - `SCALE-SDM` in Fortran, [@Sato_et_al_2018];
   - `PALM LES` in Fortran, [@Maronga_et_al_2020];
   - `LCM1D` in Python/C, [@Unterstrasser_et_al_2020];
   - `Pencil Code` in Fortran, [@Pencil_2021];
   - `NTLP` in Fortran, [@Richter_et_al_2021].
   - `superdroplet` in Python (`Cython` and `Numba`), C++, Fortran and Julia    
      (\url{https://github.com/darothen/superdroplet});

List of links directing to SDM-related files within the above projects' repositories
  is included in the `PySDM` README file.

Python packages for solving the dynamics of aerosol particles with discrete-particle (moving-sectional) representation of the size spectrum include (both depend on the `Assimulo` package for solving ODEs):

   - `pyrcel`, [@Rothenberg_and_Wang_2017];
   - `PyBox`, [@Topping_et_al_2018].
