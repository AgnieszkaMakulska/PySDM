# Summary

# Author contributions

EDJ led the formulation and implementation of the collisional breakup scheme with contributions from JBM.
PB led the formulation and implementation of the adaptive time-stepping schemes for diffusional and collisional growth.
KD contributed to setting up continuous integration workflows for the GPU backend.
ID and AJ contributed to the examples (CCN activation).
CES and RW contributed the treatment of organics in surface-tension models and the relevant examples.
The immersion freezing representation code was developed by SA who also carried out the maintenance of the project.
